#  Wumpus game in python

This is my very scappy implementation of the Wumpus game in python.
I did this to learn more about python and to have some fun.
I hope you enjoy it.

The idea came about after having my Artificial intelligence fundamentals class where my lecurer introduced us to the game.

So I decided to implement it in Python, Java and GO (Still working on the GO implementation).

## Timeline:

this took me 3 days to complete, I started on a friday after the class, and finished on a Monday(didn't work on it on the weekend, apart from maybe an hour) at univerisy.

## How to play
- Clone the repo
- Navigate to the directory
- install the requirements from the requirements.txt file using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the game using the command `python main.py`
- Run the game
