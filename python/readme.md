# Wumpus Game in Python

This is my implementation of the Wumpus game in Python. It's part of a larger project where I'm creating the same game in Python, Java, and Go to learn more about these languages and have some fun.

## About the Implementation

This Python version of the Wumpus game is part of a multi-language implementation project. The idea came from my Artificial Intelligence fundamentals class, where my lecturer introduced us to the game. As Python is the language I'm most comfortable with, this implementation served as the foundation for the other versions.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the Python directory
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the game using the following command:
    ```bash
   python main.py
    ```
5. Enjoy the game and happy gaming!

## Timeline

The Python implementation was the first one I completed, taking approximately 2 day of focused work. It served as the blueprint for the Java and Go versions, which were developed subsequently.

## Feedback and Contributions

While Python is my strongest language, I'm always looking to improve. If you have any suggestions for code optimization, better Pythonic practices, or additional features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!

ps: I know the code is slopppy, I did it in a hurry, I will clean it up later (maybe).
