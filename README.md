# Multi-Language Wumpus Game

Welcome to my multi-language implementation of the classic Wumpus game! This project includes versions of the game written in Python, Java, and Go(This one's still a maybe ðŸ˜…).

## About the Project

This project was inspired by my Artificial Intelligence fundamentals class, where we were learning about Propositional Logic, and were introduced to the Wumpus game, as an example. I decided to challenge myself by implementing the game in Python at first, but then thought why not java and Go too, as it would deepen my understanding of each and explore their unique characteristics.

## Implementations

- [Python Version](./python)
- [Java Version](./java/wumpus)
- [Go Version](./go)

Each directory contains its own README with specific instructions on how to run the game in that language.

## Timeline

The entire project, is not yet finished but here is a mini breakdown, for more details check the README in each language directory.:
- Python: 3 days
- Java: 5 days
- Go: Still working on it

## Learning Outcomes

This project has been an excellent opportunity to:
- Compare and contrast different programming languages
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each language
- Improve my problem-solving skills across multiple programming paradigms
- Gain hands-on experience with game logic implementation

Note: I also tried not using external libraries for anything, so I had to implement refreshing the screen in the terminal, and other things like that with no help apart from 'rich' in python, so i could be able to add colour to text (even though I thing I didn't need it).

## Feedback and Contributions

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions to any of the language implementations. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests!

Happy gaming, and may you always avoid the Wumpus!
