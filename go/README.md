# Wumpus Game in Go

This is my implementation of the Wumpus game in Go. It's part of a larger project where I'm creating the same game in Python, Java, and Go to learn more about these languages and have some fun.

## About the Implementation

This Go version of the Wumpus game is part of a multi-language implementation project. The idea came from my Artificial Intelligence fundamentals class, where my lecturer introduced us to the game. Of the three languages used in this project, Go is the one I have the least experience with, making this implementation an exciting learning opportunity.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the Go directory
3. Ensure you have Go installed on your system
4. Run the game using the following command:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
    ```
5. Enjoy the game and happy gaming!

## Timeline

The Go implementation was the last out of the 3 to be done, and I'm still working on it. The learning curve for Go was steeper than expected, but the experience has been rewarding.

## Feedback and Contributions

As this is my first significant project in Go, I'm particularly open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you're experienced with Go and have any tips or see areas where the code could be more idiomatic, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
