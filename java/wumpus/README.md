# Wumpus Game in Java

This is my implementation of the Wumpus game in Java. It's part of a larger project where I'm creating the same game in Python, Java, and Go to learn more about these languages and have some fun.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the Java directory
3. Compile the game using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac com/ndzumamalate/wumpus/Wumpus.java
   
4. Compile the game using the following command:
   ```bash
   java com.ndzumamalate.wumpus.Wumpus

Enjoy the game and happy gaming!

# About the Implementation

This Java version of the Wumpus game is part of a larger project to implement the same game in multiple languages. The idea came from my Artificial Intelligence fundamentals class, where my lecturer introduced us to the game.

# Timeline

The Java implementation was completed after the Python version. The java project took about 4 days of focused work, spread over a 3 week.
